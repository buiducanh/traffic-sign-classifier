    "### Design and Test a Model Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the \"Stand Out Suggestions\" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "First I normalize the images in order for gradient descent to have a better convergence surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I grayscale the images because looking at the signs, they all have distinct features that do not have to do with colors. Thus, I hope that removing the colors will help the neural network learn these features. Since colors can be deceptive when there are distortions like sunlight, snow or shadows in the picture, I believe grayscale image will help the neural network be more general.\n",

    "#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the model, I used AdamOptimizer as the gradient descent algorithm, with a batch size of 128, 10 epochs, and 0.001 learning rate. The loss function is the softmax cross entropy calculated from the logits at the final layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "My final model results were:\n",
    "* training set accuracy of 0.951\n",
    "* validation set accuracy of 0.951\n",
    "* test set accuracy of 0.924\n",
    "\n",
    "If an iterative approach was chosen:\n",
    "* What was the first architecture that was tried and why was it chosen?\n",
    "I chose Lenet becaues Lenet works well with image data and it is easy to adapt.\n",
    "* What were some problems with the initial architecture?\n",
    "The architecture didn't have a good regularizer to help with overfitting.\n",
    "* How was the architecture adjusted and why was it adjusted? Typical adjustments could include choosing a different model architecture, adding or taking away layers (pooling, dropout, convolution, etc), using an activation function or changing the activation function. One common justification for adjusting an architecture would be due to overfitting or underfitting. A high accuracy on the training set but low accuracy on the validation set indicates over fitting; a low accuracy on both sets indicates under fitting.\n",
    "I added dropout layers after each fully connected layers that are not the output layer. This gives me an easy way to adjust regularization strength of the model.\n",
    "* Which parameters were tuned? How were they adjusted and why?\n",
    "I tuned on the depth of the convolutional layers, and the learning rate. I decided to make a deep first convolutional layer because I want the neural network to learn many small features from the signs, since there are 43 signs in total and each of them has small features that can be differentiated. Then I play with the learning rate until the model converge nicely.\n",
    "* What are some of the important design choices and why were they chosen? For example, why might a convolution layer work well with this problem? How might a dropout layer help with creating a successful model?\n",
    "I chose to add dropout layers because I want to regularize the model and encourage it to learn more general features, since the signs in reality can be distorted by the weather. It helps to have a way to control how much the model trusts the data.\n",

The third is hard because there is snow covering the sign. The fourth is hard because it is a drawing of the sign. The fifth one is straightforward.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set.
